INTRODUCTION
============

gtk+-aqd is inspired from the patch originally written by AqD, posted at ubuntu forum.
The original purpose for writing this patch is to give gtk applications a Mac-like menu bar.

Since the Gnome GlobalMenu project is started, we picked up AqD's idea and explained the
purpose of our work as providing a global menu for gnome applications.

HOW DOES IT WORK
================

After several major changes in the framework, we ended up with very little modifications in GTK.
The patch only does 1 thing:
	1) search for gnomenu_menu_bar_type when gtk_menu_bar_get_type is invoked.
		if found, return it to tell every application to use GnomenuMenuBar,
		if not found, return GTK_MENU_BAR, to tell them to use GtkMenuBar.


HACKING
========

make prepare
-------------
	Download gtk source from gtk svn;

make patch
-----------
	Patch the downloaded GTK source;
	After patching the source, you can follow the conventional steps to build GTK.
	REMEMBER to add the path for libgnomenu.so to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH and GTK_MODULES before testing.

make diff
----------
	Generate new patch from hacked code

svn commit
-----------
	Sumit your changes.
